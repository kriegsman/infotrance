			it all started in 2005, listening to a psytrance cd in the car,
			and then switching to npr news, and then realizing that since
			the car stereo had both a cd player <i>and</i> an fm tuner, 
			and that there was no good <i>technical</i> reason for not being able to listen to
			a wordless psytrance cd and and fm talk radio at the same time -- and 
			suddenly it seemed like an obviously great and compelling idea.  a moral imperative. 
			</p>
			<p>the problem was that every single damn audio equipment manufacturer
			had somehow gotten it into their head that people only wanted to listen
			to <i>one</i> audio source at a time.  well, a certain kind of person can only
			stand this sort of problem for a short time before something must be done.  and that something 
			is this: infotrance, infotran.cc.
			</p>
			<p>there's more going on under the hood here than is initially apparent.  there's
			support for mp3 radio stations, as well as for wma and ra streams.  there's built-in
			support for playing podcasts, and for custom playlists.  there's support for end-user
			customization (adding your own info and trance streams).  spoken-word podcasts can 
			be played back faster or slower than normal speed.  you can create custom bookmarkable
			urls for stream combinations, and share them with friends.  but of course, that's
			pretty much all undocumented at this point.
			</p>
			<p>documentation, apis, and examples
			are what will come next.  for now though, just <a href="play/index.html">play with the beta.</a>
